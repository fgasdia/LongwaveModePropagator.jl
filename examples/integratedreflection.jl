# # Solvers for ionosphere reflection coefficient
#
# LongwaveModePropagator uses the technique presented by
# [Budden (1955)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1955.0027) to compute the reflection
# coefficient of a horiontally stratified ionosphere consisting of an
# anisotropic, collisional plasma.
#
# Budden (1955) derives a differential equation for the reflection coefficient
# ``\bm{R}``:
# ```math
# \frac{2i}{k}\frac{\mathrm{d}\bm{R}}{\mathrm{d}z} = W_{21} + W_{22}\bm{R} - \bm{R}W_{11} - \bm{R}W_{12}\bm{R}
# ```
# where ``W`` is a ``4\times 4`` matrix divided into four ``2\times 2`` submatrices
# each containing components of the ``\bm{T}`` matrix.
#
# To obtain the reflection coefficient ``\bm{R}`` at any level, we integrate
# ``\mathrm{d}\bm{R}/\mathrm{d}z`` downward through the ionosphere from a great height
# and the height at which we stop is ``\bm{R}`` for a sharp boundary at that level with
# free space below.
#
# The reflection coefficient matrix ``\bm{R}`` consists of four complex reflection
# coefficients for the different combinations of incident and reflected wave
# polarization. These reflection coefficients are also functions of the wave
# angle of incidence, and therefore the integration of ``\mathrm{d}\bm{R}/\mathrm{d}z``
# occurs tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of times for every
# `HomogeneousWaveguide` in the GRPF mode finder. It is therefore extremely important
# that the differential equations solver be as efficient as possible to minimize
# runtime.
# The mode finder is responsible for more than 90% of the runtime of
# LongwaveModePropagator, and most of the mode finder runtime is the ionosphere
# reflection coefficient integration.
#
# In this example, we will compare solvers and tolerances from
# DifferentialEquations to determine the most efficient combination with reasonable
# robustness and accuracy.
# We will begin by looking at the reflection coefficients as a function of height.
#
# First we load the packages we need.

# of height.
# 
# We will use a typical daytime ionosphere with a Wait and Spies (1964) profile
# and a wave frequency of 24 kHz.
# The background magnetic field will be vertical with a magnitude of 50,000 nT.
# We also need to specify the wave angle of incidence on the ionosphere.
# We'll use a real ``\theta = 75°``.

# We start the integration at a "great height".
# For longwaves, anything above the D-region is fine.
# LongwaveModePropagator defaults to a `topheight` of 110 km.

Rtop = LMP.bookerreflection(θ, Mtop)

# The starting solution `Rtop` comes from a solution of the Booker quartic for the
# wavefields at `topheight`.
# 
# We use OrdinaryDiffEq.jl to integrate [`LongwaveModePropagator.dRdz`](@ref).
# Although it's not needed for computing the ionosphere reflection coefficient,
# `dRdz` takes a `ModeEquation` argument, specifying a complete waveguide,
# including `Ground`, for convenience.
